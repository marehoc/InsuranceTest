The total loss is paid in total  :-)  by us (=company) and client. These are called costs.
So if we sum both graphs (see jpg) the result is linear function y=x, where:
y=costs
x=total loss

Option is defined as [peril X location]. You can see it as point in 2D matrix of possisble options. Maybe some other termin would be better, combination, ... ??
Region = Location.

If L = 0 we naver pay any money. See theory test for [InlineData(0, 11, 10, 0)].
